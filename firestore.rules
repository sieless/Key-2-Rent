/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles and listings, with public read access for listings.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles.
 * - /listings/{listingId}: Stores rental property listings with a denormalized userId field.
 * - /rental_types/{rentalTypeId}: Stores categories of rental options.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profiles.
 * - Listings are publicly readable, but only the owner can create, update, or delete them.
 * - Listing ownership is determined by the `userId` field on the listing document.
 * - Rental types are publicly readable. Write operations are not permitted.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `listings` collection denormalizes the `userId` to avoid costly `get()` calls when checking listing ownership.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Public listings are stored in a top-level collection, while private user data is stored under `/users/{userId}`.
