## 📋 KNOWN ISSUES / NOTES

### Expected Behavior:
1. **Image Upload Delay:** Images take 5-10 seconds to appear after listing creation (non-blocking upload). This is intentional - prevents UI freezing.
2. **Firestore Rules:** Script requires admin authentication, so we created browser-based init page instead.
3. **Favicon:** Already exists at `/src/app/favicon.ico` - Next.js 15 automatically uses it.

### Future Enhancements (Post-Launch):
- [ ] M-Pesa payment integration (when admin enables contact payments)
- [ ] Email notifications for new listings
- [ ] Landlord analytics dashboard improvements
- [ ] Tenant saved searches

---
