## ⚠️ **PENDING (Requires Manual Action)**

### **1. Vercel Deployment** 🔴 **CRITICAL**
```bash
# You need to run:
vercel login
vercel --prod
```

**Why Manual:**
- CLI requires interactive authentication
- I cannot authenticate on your behalf

**Once Deployed:**
- Live URL: `https://key-2-rent-ecru.vercel.app`
- Auto-deploys on future git pushes

---

### **2. Admin Initialization** 🟡 **HIGH PRIORITY**
```
URL: https://key-2-rent-ecru.vercel.app/admin/init
Login: titwzmaihya@gmail.com
Action: Click "Run Initialization"
```

**What It Does:**
- Creates `/platformSettings/config` in Firestore
- Sets all payment features to OFF (FREE mode)
- Adds `images: []` to existing listings

**Run Once:** After Vercel deployment

---
