## 💡 INSIGHTS & RECOMMENDATIONS

### What Worked Well:
1. **Feature flag pattern** - Admin can toggle features without deployment
2. **localStorage for favorites** - Instant UX, simple implementation
3. **Client-side analytics** - No backend needed
4. **Sentry pre-configuration** - Ready when needed, not blocking launch

### Challenges Encountered:
1. **Build time increased** - From 21s to 41s (acceptable trade-off)
2. **File count growing** - 18+ new files (good organization mitigates this)
3. **Master plan scope** - Very large (100+ features), need to prioritize

### For Future Development:
1. **Prioritize user-requested features** over master plan order
2. **Consider analytics data** before building speculative features
3. **Keep free tier limits in mind** (Firestore reads, Sentry events)
4. **Test on real devices** before each major release
